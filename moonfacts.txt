The Moon is the Earth's only permanent natural satellite
The Moon has a 27-day, 7 hour, 43 minute orbit around the Earth
The Moon sometimes has companions - Small asteroids enter temporary orbits around the Earth, like mini-Moons
The Moon is on average 384,400 km (238,900 mi) away from the Earth - To visualize this, if the Earth was a basketball and the Moon was a tennis ball, they would be placed 7.3 m (24 ft) apart
Without the Moon, the Earth would have maintained its original rotation speed of around 4,000 mph, 4x faster than it rotates today. This means that days would only be 6 hours long
The most accepted theory about the creation of the Moon was that a Mars-Sized planet named Theia smashed into the Earth roughly 4.5 billion years ago, with that material forming the early Moon
For some time after the collision that formed the Moon, there would have been a ring much like Saturn's in Earth's sky
Apollo Astronauts returned samples from the Moon that were incredibly similar to the Earth's crust, evidence that the Moon's material was once one and the same as the Earth's
Only 24 people have ever orbited the Moon, and just 12 people have walked on its surface
The last Apollo mission lifted off from the Moon on December 14th, 1972, and we have not been back - yet
Out of the 12 people who walked on the Moon, 11 were pilots by profession, and 1 was a geologist
The LSM, the lander that brought Apollo astronauts to the Moon, was made so light to save weight that you could punch through the side of the lander with a clenched fist
The depths of some craters on the Moon never see sunlight - Meaning billions of years of material, including water, have built up into resource rich areas for future explorers to use
The Moon is the 5th largest Moon in the Solar System, behind (in increasing size): Io, Callisto, Titan, and Ganymede
The Moon's "oceans" - Known as Lunar Maria, were once indeed oceans of molten rock, created when a large object would hit the far side of the Moon
Two Soviet spacecraft hold "first" records for lunar science, Luna 2, which was the first spacecraft to impact the Moon, and Luna 3, which was the first spacecraft to photograph the dark side
Sometimes, during the crescent phases of the Moon, the dark part of the Moon becomes illuminated by light coming from the Earth, and then reflected back off the surface of the Moon
Drag created by the Moon in the form of tides is slowly decreasing the Earth's rotation, which in turn is slowly increasing the Moon's orbital velocity, leading to the Moon moving 4 cm away from Earth every year
It is expected that due to the Moon drifting away from the Earth, the last total solar eclipse will happen about 1.2 billion years from now
Alan Shepard, the first American in space, was the oldest man to walk on the Moon, aged 47. Fittingly, he is also the only person to have played golf on the Moon
